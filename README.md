# Python Coding Challenges

This repository contains solutions to various coding challenges in Python, primarily focused on Leetcode-style problems. 
It covers a variety of topics including arrays, strings, numbers, and other fundamental data structures and algorithms.

# Topics Covered
Arrays: Challenges involving common operations on arrays such as searching, sorting, and manipulation.
Strings: Problems that involve string manipulation, parsing, and pattern matching.
Numbers: Challenges related to number theory, mathematical computations, and basic algorithmic concepts.

# Prerequisites
1. Install Python from the official site or using Homebrew : `brew install python`
2. Install IDE ( Pycharm preffered).


# Structure 
Each challenge file includes:

1. Problem description
2. Python solution
3. Example input 

# How to run 

You can clone this repository and open it in preffered IDE ( I have used Pycharm).
run specific file : `python filename.py`

# Future Improvements
Add more medium and hard-level challenges.
Include explanations and time/space complexity analysis for each solution.
